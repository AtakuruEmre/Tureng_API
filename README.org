# Tureng_API
This program aims to using TURENG translate feature on terminal. I want to write this API because When you want to translate something on terminal, you can use just google-translate but sometimes google-translate doesn't enough some reasons.

Example Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from Tureng_API import *

dict_ = {}

translated = Tureng_translate("Buch","DE-EN",dict_,1)

print(dict_)
  
#+END_SRC
